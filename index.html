        <h2>Exception handling in python</h2>
    </div><br>
        <p>
            An exception in Python is an incident that happens while executing a program that causes the regular course of the program's commands to be disrupted. When a Python code comes across a condition it can't handle, it raises an exception. An object in Python that describes an error is called an exception. When a Python code throws an exception, it has two options: handle the exception immediately or stop and quit. Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code results in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.

            <ol>
                <li>Syntax error</li>
                <li>Logical error</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 style="color: crimson;">Try-except clause:</h3>
            The idea of the try-except clause is to handle exceptions (errors at runtime).
            try: The code with the exception(s) to catch. If an exception is raised, it jumps straight into the except block.
            except: This code is only executed if an exception occured in the try block. The except block is required with a try block, even if it contains only the pass statement.
            After the except block, the program continues. Without a try-except block, the last line wouldnâ€™t be reached as the program would crash.
